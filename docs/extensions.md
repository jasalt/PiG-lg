# Pig extensions

Pig extensions are external programs that add tools, commands, events,
providers, renderers, and UI behavior. Pig hosts them through the current
subprocess wire. A Piglet Binary can fuse a compatible Go factory, but fused
behavior must match subprocess behavior.

Pig does not use PigScript, embedded JavaScript, WASM, dynamic Go plugins, or an
authored extension manifest.

## Source forms

Pig accepts exactly two forms.

### Conventional factory

Use one standard factory for the language:

- Go: `func Extension() *sdk.Extension`
- Rust: `pub fn new_extension() -> Extension` in `src/lib.rs`
- Python: `def new_extension() -> Extension` in one module
- Node: one Pi-compatible default export

Pig generates the runner. Go, Rust, and Python factories can share a
language-specific runtime cell. Node factories run in isolated Node processes.

### Exact standalone

Use an exact executable or conventional executable source:

- Go: an exact module with executable `package main`
- Rust: an exact crate with `src/main.rs` and no factory library
- Python: executable `main.py` with a shebang
- Node: an exact executable script with a shebang
- Native: an exact executable file

Every standalone runs in an isolated process.

Pig rejects mixed languages, several factories, factory-plus-standalone roots,
nonstandard factory symbols, missing entrypoints, and identity mismatches. Select
a narrower source root when a directory is ambiguous.

## TypeScript async is a contract, not a goroutine instruction

The Go SDK already dispatches every inbound handler on its own goroutine. Keep
awaited work inside the handler and return its error. The request-scoped `sdk.Context` is cancelled when the handler returns.

Translate `await Promise.all` into owned concurrent work that joins before the
handler returns. Never use a naked fire-and-forget goroutine. A deliberately
unawaited task needs independent cancellation, error reporting, and shutdown
draining.

## Identity and capabilities

The selecting Package or Piglet name supplies the expected extension identity.
Direct directory selections use the directory name, and direct files use the
file stem. Runtime registration must match that identity. Runtime registration is the only source for tools, commands,
events, providers, renderers, descriptions, and other capabilities.

A Package contributes only exact members from its extension inventory. Source
markers at an arbitrary Package root do not make that Package an extension.

## Discovery

Pig collects extensions from these sources:

1. `~/.pig/agent/extensions`
2. trusted `<cwd>/.pig/extensions`
3. configured Package extension members
4. selected Piglet composition
5. exact paths in settings
6. explicit `-e` paths
7. embedded or fused Piglet Binary components

`--no-extensions` disables ambient discovery and settings, but it preserves
explicit `-e` paths. Project discovery requires trust. Startup and `/reload`
use the same normalized resolver.

Pig does not discover `~/.pig/extensions`.

## Scaffold

Create a factory:

```bash
pig extension init ./my-extension --lang go
```

Create a standalone:

```bash
pig extension init ./my-extension --lang go --isolated
```

Supported scaffold languages are Go, Python, Rust, and let-go. The scaffold
writes no YAML file. Pig stages the matching SDK under the active config root.
A let-go scaffold (`--lang let-go`) is interpreted source, so it has no SDK to
stage and no build step; see [Writing let-go extensions](letgo-extensions.md).

## Validation

Validate one source:

```bash
pig install ./my-extension --validate-only --json
```

Validate a set:

```bash
pig install --validate-only --json ./ext-a ./ext-b
```

Validation resolves the source form, builds or launches it, accepts runtime
registration, verifies identity, detects duplicate capabilities, and reports the
placement plan. It does not install the source.

## Authentication inspection

An extension declares OAuth through runtime provider registration. Before a
session, `pig login --list` resolves enabled extensions. Pig starts each source
extension that has no valid projection for its exact source configuration and
immutable artifact digest. Pig accepts registration, collects OAuth providers,
and stops the extension. A valid projection avoids startup. Pig dispatches no
session, tool, command, event, shortcut, or renderer handler during inspection.
Embedded packed members are inspected independently through the complete
compiled artifact.

Duplicate provider IDs fail and name both owners. Login starts only the owning
extension. Embedded and fused extensions use the same registration contract.

## Liveness

The SDK answers heartbeat directly. Tools, commands, events, and shortcuts have
no completion or inactivity timeout. Their caller-owned context controls
cancellation. Renderers use generation-scoped inactivity and retain the last
completed frame. A pong proves transport health.

See `docs/extension-authoring.md` and `docs/extension-api-parity.md`.

## Session context

PiG loads session history for an extension only when the extension reads it. A
persisted session is read from its local JSONL file and reconciled with the host
cursor. If the file is unavailable, the host sends ordered pages of at most 4
MB. Later appends use the same bounded path.

## Reload

`/reload` resolves the same extension inputs as startup and preserves their first-seen order. Pig reuses valid build artifacts, but it constructs a fresh factory and runtime for every configured, embedded, fused, and built-in extension so module and closure state reset as they do in Pi. It starts and validates replacements, checks registration, and publishes the successful set. A failed extension is removed and reported while other extensions load.

## Product boundary

`plugin.json` is cross-tool marketplace metadata. It does not contain Pig
runtime fields. A deployment resource can point at extension source or
artifacts and calls the same Pig validation path. It does not define the local
Pig runtime source contract.
